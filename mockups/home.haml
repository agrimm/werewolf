    %p.bold Summoned by the lunar cycle, wolves lurk in the darkness. While we sleep, they feast on our flesh. Month after month our numbers are savaged by the Beasts. Nobody deserves the fate bequeathed by them as it is to die a thousand deaths. They don't distinguish between women or children or the sick or the strong. Enough, brothers! No more. We must act first and lynch any who we suspect of turning. The souls of the saved shall forgive our injustices <span class="amp">&amp;</span> the Lord shall guide us through err. Come, join the hunt, lest you be of Beast yourself&hellip;
    
    %h2#wtf What is Werewolf?
    
    %p Werewolf is a party game with a psychological edge. It is all about controlling groups. Think 'Lord of the Flys', but uh&hellip; without pigs. Really though, it's simple to pick up <em>and</em> lots of fun to play.

      If you've never played before, don't worry, turn up anyway! You'll learn <em>very</em> quickly by playing. However, for the curious visitor, here is a brief overview: the game starts with the players sitting in a circle. A moderator secretly assigns each person to either be a "werewolf" or a "villager". The game then goes in turns. During the "night", only the werewolves are allowed to open their eyes and they can signal villager to be killed. During "daylight" everybody opens their eyes (werewolves included) and somebody is chosen to be lynched. The game keeps going until either group is dead. The
